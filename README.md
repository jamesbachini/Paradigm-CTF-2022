# Paradigm CTF 2022

Only managed to get a couple of the easiest challenges done before I got addicted to the 0xMonaco challenge.

The car that got up to 1350 ELO and top 5 was the contracts/LewisHamiltonBKUP.sol one. After that I tried to refactor it and broke everything.

Code is untested and ever so slightly gross, sorry.
